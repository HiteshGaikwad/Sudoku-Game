The board consists of 81 cells, which is divided into nine 3X3 sub boards and each 3X3 sub board is called “box” or “region”. The main concept of the game is to place numbers from 1 to 9 on a 9X9 board so that every row, column and box contains any numbers but once. This means that no number is repeated more than once.
